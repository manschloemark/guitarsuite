# Guitar Practice Suite (WIP)

This program streamlines the monotonous parts of guitar practice.

## Practices

### 60 second chord changes
  - pick a pair of chords and play them as many times as possible in one minute.
  - record your scores to get feedback on which pairs of chords you need to work on
  - pick a random pair to play
  - weighted random: more likely to choose pairs with lower high scores

## TODO
  - Add more features to the chord changes practice
    - add a decay attribute to each chord pair - the longer it has been since you played it, the more you are urged to practice it
    - add a stats screen / widget where you can view a graph of your recent sessions
    - add sounds to the timer start and end
  - When I learn more about guitar and music theory I'll add some more features to this.
    - tools to practice chord progressions
    - scale practice
  - Add a metronome feature
